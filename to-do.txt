1. Add integration/support for todoist or msft todo/outlook integration
2. Simple shortcut at the end of the day that copies all set(tasks) to the clipboard for users ease of potentially entering into a spreadsheet.
3. make pygame always on top
4. Maybe have flash notifications on a timer like. Every 10 minutes a popup that shows "drink water"
5. On boot show a little button that lets the user move to a new monitor. Perhaps store their preference in the db.
6. Consider pomodoro timer app
7. Need a method for 'doneing' a task
8. It'd be nice if I could adjust the font size based on the length of the task name. Would need to support varried monitor resolutions.
9. A simple way to track water consumption with a little blue bar that goes accross the screen. 
10. New DB table for tracking what project the current task is associated with. Flow I'm envisioning would be. Enter Task. Fuzzy matching looks at previous tasks, attempts to guess a project. Weighted to what I've been working on in the past ~7 days.  Gives the user like 3-4 choices that are simple buttons. If none of the buttons are right then give the user a combobox.
11. Possibly implement something like this https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard
12. Tracker for pushups/handstands. Add a little gui report with matplotlib charts or something. lets bloat this up!
